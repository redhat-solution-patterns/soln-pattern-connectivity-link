== Dynamic Plugin

Connectivity Link provides a Dynamic plugin to help you view the relevant resources from a single pane of glass.

* Enable this plugin as guided in this interactive demo

* The plugin's overview shows all the relevant Kubernetes resources from Gateway API (Gateways and HTTPRoutes) and also the Connectivity Link policies

* Here the `(AP) prod-web-deny-all` is marked as `Accepted (Not Enforced)`, because this AuthPolicy is accepted, but is overridden by the other policies `(AP) echo-api-allow-all` and `(AP) globex-mobile-gateway`
* Explore the policies from one single place.
* The Policy Topology view visualizes the relationships and interactions between different resources within your cluster related to Kuadrant, allowing you to explore connections between Gateways, HTTPRoutes and Kuadrant Policies.

== Observability

Connectivity Link provides a variety of starting points for monitoring your Connectivity Link installation in the Kuadrant upstream project  https://github.com/Kuadrant/kuadrant-operator/tree/main/examples[(examples from kuadrant.io)^] folder. These dashboards and alerts are ready-to-use and easily customizable to fit your environment.

The example dashboards uploaded to https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/[Grafana.com^]

== Conclusion

With this setup, Globex is all set to onboard further service enpoints to be accessed securely. This solution can be further extended to span across a multi-cluster setup too.

We will also extend this pattern to include the all important Observability aspects as well.
