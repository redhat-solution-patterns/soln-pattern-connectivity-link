= See the Solution in Action


This solution walks you through the activities from the lens of a Platform Engineer and a Developer. But first, we need a few prerequisites before getting started.


== Prerequisites

To provision the demo you will perform the following steps - each of which is explained in detail in the next sections:

* You will need an OpenShift cluster with *`cluster-admin` privileges*. This solution pattern has been tested on OpenShift 4.16 and 4.17
* Ensure you have the *tools* `oc` and `ansible` installed in your local environment such as your laptop
* Access to *AWS Route53* or *Google Cloud DNS* to be able to create new domain names

=== CLI tools

To check if you have the cli tools, you can open your terminal and use following commands:

******
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
oc version #openshift cli client
ansible --version
ansible-galaxy --version
ansible-galaxy collection list #the list should include kubernetes.core and amazon.aws.route53 (version 8.1.0 ) module
----
******

Please run these commands to ensure you have the right dependencies
******
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
pip install openshift pyyaml kubernetes botocore boto3
ansible-galaxy collection install kubernetes.core amazon.aws community.general
----
******


=== Managed Zone on AWS

It is good to note that you  need a hosted zone as a *subdomain* in AWS Route53 ] (for example, managed.myrootdomain.com) for the applications that you want to manage and secure with Connectivity Link.


This *subdomain*  is automatically setup by the deployment scripts. But you will need to update the `inventory` file with the root domain of AWS Route53 when you are instructed to in next sections. +

Ref: https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/create-subdomain-route-53[this article^] to know more about how a Route53 subdomain can be created.


=== Personalize the instructions
To personalize the rest of the instructions to your OpenShift environment:

* At the top-right of this page enter the following information under the *Your Workshop Environment* section 
** *AWSROOTZONE* is the Root Route53 domain of your AWS environment.
+
[NOTE]
=====
The AWSROOTZONE would look something like this `mycluster.abc.com` or `sandbox100.opentlc.com`
=====
** *OPENSHIFTSUBDOMAIN* to match your OpenShift cluster 
+
[NOTE]
=====
The OPENSHIFTSUBDOMAIN would look something like this `apps.mycluster.myopenshift.com`
=====

* Press enter or click on the Set button

* The menubar and the rest of this walkthrough guide will be updated with the Managed Zone name and the subdomain as shown below

== Platform Setup

This section is typically performed by a *Platform Engineer* persona.

The primary goal of a Platform Engineer is to deploy a Gateway that provides secure communication and is protected and ready for use by application development teams to deploy their service endpoints or APIs. This gateway should be protected and secured with global rate limiting and auth policies.

In this demo, the deployment script uses ArgoCD to:

* Install Red Hat Connectivity Link (Kuadrant) operator 
* Setup a ManagedZone for DNS configuration. 
* Define a TLS issuer for TLS certificates for secure communication to the Gateways.
* Create a Gateway (based on Istio gateway) with a wildcard hostname based on the root domain.
* Kuadrant Custom Resources (CRs) including various policies: DNS, TLS.


=== Get the deployment scripts

* Login to your OpenShift cluster as cluster-admin (because a number of operators will need to be installed)
* Click on the username on the top right hand, and then click on *Copy login command*. This will open another tab and you will need to login again
* Click on *Display token* link, and copy the command under *Log in with this token*. This will look like this
******
[source,shell script]
----
oc login --token=<token> --server=<server>
----
******


* Clone the ansible script
+
----
git clone https://github.com/rh-soln-pattern-connectivity-link/connectivity-link-ansible
----


* Open the `inventories/inventory.template` file and update the variables. Save the file.

=== Run the deployment scripts

*Prerequisites checklist*

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before running the following Ansible script, check if you have done these prerequisites
[%interactive]
** [ ] The inventory file reflects the correct AWS credentials, Root zone details and region etc.
====


Run the Ansible script which will setup the RHCL Operator, Cert Manager Operator, OpenShift Service Mesh Operator, Istio CR and other Kuadrant system workloads

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
cd operator-setup 
ansible-playbook playbooks/ocp4_workload_connectivity_link.yml -e ACTION=create -i inventories/inventory.template
